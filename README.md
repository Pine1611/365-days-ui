365 days with UI

# The collection of ui-buttons, ui-inputs, ui-form... and more...

This repository stores ideas for creating beautiful buttons, inputs, form, nav... using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Some examples I have learned from other developers, and some I have created myself. I hope everyone enjoys them. Feel free to use these examples in your own projects.
